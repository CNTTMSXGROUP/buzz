/**
 * Drive a permission decision to the agent harness with a retransmit-until-acked
 * loop, so an owner's click survives a harness socket that is briefly down.
 *
 * The send side is otherwise fire-and-forget: `sendPermissionDecision` publishes
 * one `permission_decision` observer control frame and the harness replies out
 * of band with a `control_result`. Kind-24200 control frames are ephemeral — the
 * relay never stores them — so a frame that reaches the relay while the agent's
 * subscription is down is dropped and never delivered. A single fire-and-forget
 * send therefore has no delivery guarantee: the card would hang until the 300 s
 * fail-closed timeout even though the owner decided promptly.
 *
 * This orchestrator resends the decision on a fixed cadence until it observes a
 * `control_result` for THIS nonce, then stops. The outcome depends on the frame's
 * status: `sent` and `already_decided` mean the harness routed or previously
 * forwarded/delivery-suppressed the decision — the loop resolves `"acked"`. The four failure statuses
 * (`no_active_turn`, `channel_full`, `channel_closed`, `no_channel`) mean the
 * harness received the frame but could not route it — the loop resolves
 * `"failed"`, stopping retransmission (re-sending the same nonce cannot change an
 * authoritative routing refusal), and the card returns to the actionable state for
 * owner retry. If no reply arrives before the card's own `expiresAt` deadline the
 * loop resolves `"expired"`: the card times out on its own and a decision applied
 * past expiry would be rejected anyway, so retransmitting past it is pointless.
 *
 * A nonce guard scopes the settling frame to this exact decision: a replayed or
 * concurrent `control_result` for a different card carries a different nonce and
 * is inert, mirroring the `requestId` guard in `awaitLiveSwitchOutcome`.
 *
 * A send rejection is the transport failure this loop exists to survive, so the
 * orchestrator never throws: the first send and every retransmit run through
 * the same guarded path, and a rejected attempt is swallowed — the next tick
 * retries. This guarantees exactly one loop per click (the UI's disabled state
 * guards double-click) and no unhandled rejection on any path. Permanent send
 * failure therefore ends the same way as silence: the loop retries until
 * `expiresAt`, then resolves `"expired"` and the card fails closed.
 *
 * The loop is isolated from React and the relay so it can be unit tested with a
 * fake clock and synthetic frames. The caller injects the send, the
 * `control_result` subscription, and the retransmit scheduler.
